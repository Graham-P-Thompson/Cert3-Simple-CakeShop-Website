# Cert3-Simple-CakeShop-Website

## Description

This is a simple website I have built using HTML and CSS as part of my IT Certificate 3 qualification at tafe in 2022.

The scenario we were given was to produce a simple website for a local cake shop to promote thier products.

As part of the project we were asked to carry out the following tasks:
- Use an IDE for the development process
- Source sutible images, edit and resize them for use on our website
- Carry out W3C validation on the HTML markup we had produced
- Use an FTP client to upload our website files to a hosting service
